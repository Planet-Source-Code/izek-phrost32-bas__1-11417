### Description

Okie this is for all you AOL people. This is a module i have been putting together for a while now. When i was writing it i didnt write it with intention of giving it out, so its not commented. Begginers will not understand this code, but will be able to use it. Advanced people should be able to understand it, but i dont suggest messing with it because you can mess something up. I tested each function/sub and tried to make it as good as possible. Tell me what you think of it and dont forget to vote.
